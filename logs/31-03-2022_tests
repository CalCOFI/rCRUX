Found two simple errors (mistyped variable names etc). Trying again. At the very least it worked...

Both rendered one response of size 44738048
The second also rendered a response of size 460064. As expected that results in a slightly larger output. (28,276 KB with taxonomy, 6,337 KB without vs 28,288 KB with taxonomy, 6,340 KB without)
