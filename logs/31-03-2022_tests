Found two simple errors (mistyped variable names etc). Trying again. At the very least it worked...

Both rendered one response of size 44738048
The second also rendered a response of size 460064. As expected that results in a slightly larger output. (28,276 KB with taxonomy, 6,337 KB without vs 28,288 KB with taxonomy, 6,340 KB without)

Running the following:

                         word_size='6', MAX_TARGET_PER_TEMPLATE = '5000',
                         NUM_TARGETS_WITH_PRIMERS ='500000',

                         num_permutations = 25, hitsize='1000000', evalue='100000',

So it looks like I accidentally pointed them at the same folder. Similar results however. The main purpose was to verify that removing the defaults didn't break anything.
