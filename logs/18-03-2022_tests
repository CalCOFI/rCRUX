Trying

get_blast_seeds("TAGAACAGGCTCCTCTAG" , "TTAGATACCCCACTATGC" ,
                "D:/blast_seeds", "12S_V5F1", "D:/accessionTaxa.sql",
                organism = c("7776"))
                
after cleaning up get_blast_seeds in a way that should preserve its functionality, only making it a bit more efficient and elegant.

Arguments aren't being passed correctly... I'll further clean that up then try to do this again tomorrow.
