Testing new wrapper function try_parse_hits

Trying

test1 <- get_blast_seeds("TAGAACAGGCTCCTCTAG", "TTAGATACCCCACTATGC",
                         blast_seeds_parent, "12S_V5F1_1", accession_taxa_path,
                         num_permutations = 25, hitsize='1000000', evalue='100000',
                         word_size='6', MAX_TARGET_PER_TEMPLATE = '5000',
                         NUM_TARGETS_WITH_PRIMERS ='500000',
                         organism = c("7776"), return_table = FALSE)
                         
Worked the same as before (this is expected; there are usually no errors to catch.)
